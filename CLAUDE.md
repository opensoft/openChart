## Shared OpenSpec/Speckit Protocol

This repo uses the user-global OpenSpec/Speckit workflow instead of duplicating
process rules in every repository.

- Global agent entrypoint: `$HOME/.agents/AGENTS.md`
- Workflow protocol: `$HOME/.agents/protocols/openspec-speckit-workflow.md`
- Bootstrap contract: `$HOME/.agents/protocols/project-agent-bootstrap.md`

Repo-local sections below remain authoritative for project-specific commands,
runtime prerequisites, source-of-truth docs, tests, and deployment constraints.

## Triad layout

Specifications and contracts are in spec/. Implementation and tests are in code/.
Run make validate from this assembly root. Live evidence is written under spec/specs/.
